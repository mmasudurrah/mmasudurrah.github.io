I am committed to developing fundamental machine learning algorithms for medical surgery, with a focus on robotic surgery. I develop algorithms to automate the process of medical surgery, particularly focusing on vision-language models, deep reinforcement learning, and generative modeling. I have contributed to developing techniques that achieve super-human (super-surgeon) level accuracy in determining surgical decision-making for burn wound patients using ultrasound data. In teleoperated robotic surgery, my method achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness in delay tolerance and accuracy in completing surgical tasks. These developments require solving fundamental challenges that are absent in traditional machine learning. These challenges include data distribution shifts, limited data availability, and the lack of explainability in decision-making.

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the department of Computer Science at the Purdue University. My advisor is Professor Yexiang Xue.

I completed my M.S. from the department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia in 2018. Before joining the University of Virginia, I worked as a Lecturer in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the BRAC University. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2013.
