I develop algorithms to automate the process of medical surgery, particularly focusing on vision-language models, deep reinforcement learning, and generative modeling. These developments require solving fundamental challenges that are absent in traditional machine learning, including data distribution shifts, limited data availability, and the lack of explainability in decision-making. </p> <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. My advisor is Professor <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yexiang Xue</a>, and I closely collaborate with Professor <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jpwachs/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Juan P. Wachs</a>.</p> <p>I completed my M.S. from the department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia in 2018. Before joining the University of Virginia, I worked as a Lecturer in the Computer Science and Engineering department at the BRAC University. I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) in 2013.</p> <p><a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=0nUv7b0AAAAJ" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> <a href="https://mmasudurrah.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Md_Masudur_Rahman.pdf">CV</a></p> </body></html>
