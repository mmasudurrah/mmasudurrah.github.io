I am a machine learning researcher committed to developing fundamental learning algorithms for medical surgery, with a focus on robotic surgery. I develop algorithms to automate the process of medical surgery. These developments require solving fundamental challenges that are absent in traditional machine learning, including data distribution shifts, limited data availability, and the lack of explainability in decision-making.

<!-- I have contributed to techniques that achieve super-human (super-surgeon) level accuracy in surgical decision-making for burn wound patients. In teleoperated robotic surgery, my methods achieve state-of-the-art effectiveness in delay tolerance and accuracy in completing surgical tasks.  -->


I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. My advisor is Professor [Yexiang Xue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/), and I closely collaborate with Professor [Juan P. Wachs](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jpwachs/).
I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Virginia in 2018. Before that, I worked as a Lecturer at BRAC University from 2013 to 2015, after earning my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from BUET in 2013.

**Key Research Areas:**

**AI in Burn Care:** I have developed an AI system based on the Vision-Language Model (GPT4-Vision) for automated surgical decision-making in burn patients. This system enhances preoperative decisions, ensuring timely and accurate surgical interventions, and has demonstrated performance levels surpassing expert surgeon capabilities.

**Teleoperated Robotic Surgery:**
My work includes developing semi-autonomous telesurgery systems that can function effectively despite communication delays (5s compared to 300ms for direct teleoperation) and unreliable connections. These systems make remote surgical operations feasible, providing critical surgical care to remote, austere and underserved areas.

**Deep Reinforcement Learning:**
I develop reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to cater to the needs of surgical decision-making and robotic surgery. My methods include enhancing generalization through style transfer, increasing sample efficiency via novel policy gradient techniques, and using natural language for interpretable policy training. These approaches address challenges such as distribution shifts and primacy bias, demonstrating superior generalization and performance in various testing environments.
