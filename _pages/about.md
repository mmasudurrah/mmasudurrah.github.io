My research develops principled and adaptable intelligence for autonomous systems operating in high-stakes, uncertain environments such as healthcare and robotics.  I earned my **Ph.D. in Computer Science from Purdue University** in 2024.  I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher at Purdue**, working with [Dr. Juan P. Wachs](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jpwachs/), where I develop intelligent systems that reason, adapt, and act safely under uncertainty in real-world medical and robotic domains.  

Broadly, my work bridges reinforcement learning (**RL**) and foundation models, such as vision-language models (**VLM**), to create agents that combine data efficiency, generalization, and interpretability. I focus on unifying learning with structured reasoning through optimization, abstraction, and verification to enable intelligent systems that generalize beyond training data while maintaining safety and transparency.  

My research aims to deliver real-world impact across **AI in healthcare** and autonomous **robotics**. For instance, my **burn-diagnosis** system achieved 95% accuracy in surgical decision-making using real-patient data, outperforming traditional clinician methods (around 70% accuracy). My teleoperation framework for remote **robotic surgery** maintained robust control under network delays of up to five seconds, far exceeding the limits of conventional systems.  

Previously, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia and B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from BUET, and served as a Lecturer at BRAC University.
