My research focuses on developing principled and adaptable intelligence for autonomous systems operating in complex, high-stakes environments. I investigate generalization, and sample efficiency in decision-making under uncertainty, with an emphasis on algorithms that enable agents to reason, adapt, and act in dynamic settings. I design novel **reinforcement learning** algorithms and advance the reasoning capabilities of vision-language models (**VLMs and LLMs**), with a focus on grounded, interactive environments. These contributions enable high-impact applications, including **burn diagnosis through medical imaging**, and medical and emergency **robotics**, where systems must perceive affordances and improvise actions in unstructured, rapidly evolving conditions.


I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the Edwardson School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University, working with **Dr. Juan P. Wachs**. I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at Purdue University in 2024 under the supervision of Dr.  [Yexiang Xue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/). I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Virginia in 2018. Before that, I worked as a Lecturer at BRAC University from 2013 to 2015, after earning my B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from BUET in 2013.
