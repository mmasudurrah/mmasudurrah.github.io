I study how intelligent systems can adapt reliably when environments, objectives, and assumptions change—especially in high-stakes real-world settings such as healthcare and robotics.

My research is motivated by a recurring failure mode of modern AI systems: strong performance under static or controlled conditions often collapses when systems are deployed in dynamic environments where data is limited, objectives are underspecified, and mistakes are costly. Rather than treating these failures as edge cases, my work treats **change itself as the defining condition of intelligence**.

I focus on reinforcement learning as a foundation for adaptive decision-making, and develop principled methods that integrate learning with semantic representations, structured reasoning, and embodied interaction. Across theory, algorithms, and deployed systems, my goal is to understand why adaptation fails in practice and how intelligent systems can remain meaningful and reliable when assumptions break.

My work emphasizes real-world impact in **AI for healthcare** and **autonomous robotics**. For example, I developed a burn-diagnosis system that achieved 95% accuracy on real patient data, substantially outperforming traditional clinician-only decision processes. In robotics, I designed a teleoperation framework for remote surgical assistance that maintained stable control under network delays of up to five seconds—far exceeding the limits of conventional systems.

I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Purdue University in 2024, where I was advised by [Dr. Yexiang Xue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/), and am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at Purdue working with [Dr. Juan P. Wachs](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jpwachs/). Previously, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Virginia and a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from BUET, and served as a Lecturer at BRAC University.
