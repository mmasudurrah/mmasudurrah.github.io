I have authored numerous **peer-reviewed** publications spanning machine learning, robotics, medical imaging, and clinical research, and my work has been recognized with a **Best Paper Award**. My record includes **11 full conference papers, 5 journal articles, 8 short papers, and 8 workshop papers**, with contributions featured in workshops at NeurIPS and ICLR, as well as in leading venues such as ICRA, IROS, NAACL, and ECML-PKDD. I have also published in field-specific outlets including RO-MAN, MIUA, Military Medicine Journal, and MHSRS (the leading forum for military health research).

A reverse-chronological list of my publications is provided below. For a categorized version organized by conferences, journals, and short papers, please refer to my [CV](https://mmasudurrah.github.io/assets/pdf/CV_Md_Masudur_Rahman.pdf).
